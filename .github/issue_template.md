### Latest Nightly

<!-- Download the nightly/WIP build from the second post in the AFKMods thread
or from the #wip-builds channel on Discord. If the issue no longer occurs
with this build, *do not report it!*. That means we have are aware of it and
have already fixed it. The next stable release will have the fix. -->

- [ ] I have tried the latest nightly build and the issue still occurs.

### Asking on Discord/AFKMods

<!-- IMPORTANT: Before posting an issue, be sure to ask at the official thread

Post an issue on GitHub only *after* doing so! This way we avoid tons of
duplicate issues for problems that we are already aware of/working on
fixing. -->
